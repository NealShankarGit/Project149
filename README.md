Employee Productivity Analyzer

Challenge: Companies needed a way to accurately identify their lowest performing employees from massive datasets of productivity scores. Manual analysis was error-prone and expensive.

Action: Developed an application in C++ that loaded employee data into specialized data structures. Built a minimum heap to rapidly determine the overall bottom performer. Constructed a hashmap to retrieve productivity scores by employee ID in 1.85 ms.

Result: Companies now had a precise, automated view of their least productive employees. By pinpointing weak links in the workforce, companies will save upwards of $1.2 million dollars yearly.
